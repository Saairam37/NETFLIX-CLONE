- Responsive UI on desktop & mobile  
- Integrated with the The Movie Database (TMDb) API for fetching movie/TV data.
- Search movies, series, actors  
- View similar titles and play trailers  
- JWT-based user authentication  
- Modern tech stack built for web performance and UX

## 🚀 Core Features  
- **Responsive Design** – seamless experience across devices  
- **Search Functionality** – look up actors, movies, or TV shows  
- **Content Display** – fetch and show lists of movies/shows via TMDb  
- **Trailer Playback** – play trailers for selected titles  
- **User Search History** – store and retrieve a user’s search history  
- **Finding Similar Content** – show similar movies or TV shows  
- **Authentication / Authorization** – Users sign up, log in, and protected routes using JWT

- TMDb API key (for fetching movie/TV data)  

### Setup Instructions  

Clone the repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saairam37/NETFLIX-CLONE.git
cd NETFLIX-CLONE
````

#### Backend Setup (`/backend`)

1. Navigate into the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in `backend` directory with environment variables, for example:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_connection_string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>
   TMDB_API_KEY=<your_tmdb_api_key>
   ```
3. Install dependencies and start the server:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Frontend Setup (`/frontend`)

1. Navigate into the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in `frontend` directory (if required) and add API keys or endpoints as appropriate.
3. Install dependencies and start the frontend app:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port is set) and explore the application.

## ✅ Why This Project Matters

Streaming platforms are now mainstream. This project replicates the UX of major platforms like Netflix while using accessible tech and APIs. It’s a hands-on demonstration of how to build a full-stack application from end to end: user authentication, data fetching from an external API (TMDb), responsive UI, and polished styling. Whether you’re a learner, hobbyist, or professional developer—it’s a great showcase project.
